#Airport Application powered by Beacons
People face all the kinds of problem at airport ranging from having trouble to find the
right terminal, which terminals to avoid to where to get information about any risks or
security troubles in the area. It will be very easy for passengers if they can get solution
to all these problems. This can be done by providing IOT based Android application for
passengers in which airport authorities will send important notification, and application
which will show the path to take which avoids the infected area in case of virus outbreak
and generate automatic boarding pass for passengers from single point.

#Problem
Some passengers might miss important announcements at airport due to ignorance and
the other problem is that passengers need to wait in a queue in order to generate
boarding pass.

#Problem Solution
* When a virus/ bacteria infected patient or other hazardous materials is detected
then authorities can notify all passengers about the area to avoid at the airport.
And application will show the recommended path to take. We can show details
about the virus and show details about symptoms of particular virus when a
passenger comes in proximity of the beacon sensor.
* When passenger is in departure area, s/he will get boarding pass in notification
and s/he can also check in directly through his/her mobile and no need to wait in
queue.
* Airport Authority can quickly guide passengers to their respective terminals.
